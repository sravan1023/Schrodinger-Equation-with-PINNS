# Schrodinger-Equation-with-PINNS
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) is an approach that merges machine learning with physical principles to solve complex scientific and engineering problems. These networks are designed to handle systems governed by partial differential equations or other fundamental physical laws.
